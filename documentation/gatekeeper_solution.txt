using a cyclical topology that relies on linear channels,
the typical gatekeeper (or waiter) solution is redundant.
If every fork or philosopher always looks to the same side first,
not having one of the philosophers at the table will result in
the program getting stuck waiting for an answer from a philosopher
that still doesn't exist. As such, we need to force one of the 
forks/philosophers to look to the opposite side first. This will
break the symetry and solve the deadlock, but it will do it whether
or not all philosophers are at the table. This means that, using
linear channels, limiting the amount of philosophers at the table
doesn't actually solve anything.
